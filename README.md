# AgarCloneAndroid

This was my submission as part of an Android module for my masters, the game isn't completely finished. I initially intended to change it's look away from the agar look but ran out of time to make graphics. 

## Description
In this game you are a tiny cell fighting to survive against other competing cells hoping to become the biggest. Eat food scattered around the world while avoiding dangerous spikes and aim to become the heaviest cell in the game. 
Featuring touch based and accelerometer controls, plus a leaderboard to record your high scores on! 
Controls:
-	If using touch based controls, point to where you want your cell to go.
-	If using the accelerometer controls, tilt your phone in the direction you want your cell to go.
-	Swipe a finger across the screen to use a special ‘dash’ ability!

## Things that need doing:
- Camera zoom: currently it doesn't zoom out as you get larger which becomes a problem when you're massive
- Graphics: spike balls are just a cell with an 's' in them currently for example
- Online play: beating bots just doesn't satisfy my sadistic mind like ending the game for a real player does
